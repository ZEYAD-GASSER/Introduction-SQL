# Introduction-SQL
A summary of what I learned about databases in (DBMS) MySQL  BY Structured Query Language SQL

*********************************************************************************************************
SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases.
SQL provides a set of commands and statements that allow users to interact with databases to store, retrieve, update, and delete data.

Here are some key aspects of SQL:

1)Data Definition Language (DDL): SQL includes DDL statements such as CREATE, ALTER, and DROP, which are used to define and modify the structure and schema of a database, including tables, indexes, and constraints.

2)Data Manipulation Language (DML): SQL includes DML statements such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, which are used to manipulate and retrieve data from database tables.

3)Data Control Language (DCL): SQL includes DCL statements such as GRANT and REVOKE, which are used to control access permissions and privileges on database objects.

4)Querying and Filtering Data: SQL provides powerful capabilities for querying and filtering data using the SELECT statement. It allows you to specify conditions, join multiple tables, sort results, and aggregate data using functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.

5)Transaction Management: SQL supports transaction management to ensure the integrity and consistency of the data. It allows you to group multiple SQL statements into a single transaction and perform operations like COMMIT (to save changes) or ROLLBACK (to undo changes).

SQL is widely used in various database management systems (DBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite. It provides a standardized way to interact with databases, making it a universal language for working with relational data.
