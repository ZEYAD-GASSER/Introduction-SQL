In SQL, the CHAR and VARCHAR are data types used to store character data. Here's an explanation of each:

CHAR: The CHAR data type is used to store fixed-length character strings.
When you define a CHAR column, you specify the maximum number of characters it can hold.
The column will always occupy that fixed amount of storage, even if the actual data stored in it is shorter. 
If the data inserted into a CHAR column is shorter than the defined length, it will be padded with spaces to fill the remaining space.

For example, if you define a CHAR(10) column and insert the string 'Hello' into it,
the value will be stored as 'Hello ' (padded with spaces to reach the fixed length of 10 characters).

VARCHAR: The VARCHAR data type is used to store variable-length character strings.
Unlike CHAR, a VARCHAR column only occupies the necessary amount of storage to store the actual data.
It does not pad the data with extra spaces. The length of a VARCHAR column is flexible and can vary based on the length of the inserted data.

For example, if you define a VARCHAR(10) column and insert the string 'Hello' into it,
the value will be stored as 'Hello' without any extra spaces.
