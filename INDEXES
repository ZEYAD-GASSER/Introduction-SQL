--> INDEX (B Tree data structure)
--> Indexes are used to find values within a specific column more quickly
--> MySQL normally searches sequentially through a column
--> The longer the column, the more expensive the operation is
--> UPDATE takes more time, SELECT takes less time


-- Single column index
CREATE INDEX last_name_idx
ON customers (last_name);

alter table customers
drop index last_name_idx ;

-- Multi column index
CREATE INDEX last_name_first_name_idx
ON customers (last_name, first_name)

select * from customers
where last_name="Fish"and first_name="Fred";
